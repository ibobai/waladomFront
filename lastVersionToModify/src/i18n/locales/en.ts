    title: 'About WALADOM',
    description: 'WALADOM is an organization officially registered in France and the European Union, dedicated to protecting the rights of the Baggara and Abbala tribes in Sudan and anywhere else they reside. These communities face systematic oppression by the Sudanese armies, including: racial discrimination, denial of official documents, arbitrary arrests, aerial bombings on villages, racial incitement and tribal discrimination, physical violence and threats, forced disappearances, forced displacement, war crimes and major violations such as genocide, targeting of civilians, and the use of internationally banned weapons.  WALADOM stands as a voice for these oppressed communities, working to document human rights violations and raise awareness globally. Additionally, WALADOM aims to improve the living conditions and provide a better future for the Baggara and Abbala tribes wherever they are, through development, education, and social support. WALADOM is also committed to showing the true image of these tribes to the world, countering false allegations aimed at tarnishing their reputation. We believe in the importance of telling the truth and correcting misinformation that is used to justify systematic oppression and violations against these communities.'
